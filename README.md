# preprojects
contains some coding work for preview

## backendsite-python
Simple project files in which I made the back-end of a small website on which hotel reservations could be made. Used python for db connection and sql queries.  

## distributions_practice
In this file I practice working with the Bernoulli and Categorical Distribution in python. Creating a variable that isn't a constant but instead a distribution which can be sampled. By sampling the distributions I show that as N-number of samples grows bigger the mean of the N-samples grows closer to the true probability that the distribution is respresents. 

## language_processing
In this file I process a nltk corpus. By processing the corpus I can look up how many times a word is used, the (log) probabability that a word is used and smoothing of said probabilities. This pre-processing can be done for many reasons, for example preparing the corpus to be used as train/test data for machine-learning models, translation software and more.

## ML_customer_prediction
A real project in which predictions are made for a customer interested in getting to know which customers they should prioritise based on historic data. The data is sensitive and therefore ommitted. MergeDataset shows some actions needed before further processing on the data can be done and the machine learning models can make use of them. In machine_learning_code the data is used to train a decision tree and random forest model. These models are then used to predict whether a new customer is likely to become a client. This is done based on the data of old customers and whether they ultimately became a client.
